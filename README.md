# STAT_TEST

This is a start-up parckage for general STATISTIC TEST problems.
It should be applicable to pure statistic problems, time-series analysis, and other related econometric researches.
Most programs are included in header files to prevent compiling problems for general compilers.
This package would be updated gradually accompanying my research concerns in econometrics and finance.




# namespaces:
### STAT_TEST              :: parent namespace with basic structs, funcs, classes, etc.
### STAT_TEST::EQUAL_TEST  :: namespace explicitly for equal-distribution-testing problems
